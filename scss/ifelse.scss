// write a mixin called "mq" that uses keywords to determine which media query to implement
// "medium" = 480px, "large" = 800px






// Modify that mixin to test if the "hidpi" or "retina" keyword is given,
// and serve up an appropriate media query for that.





// Now assign those keywords to a list, and have Sass return an error if
// an invalid keyword is passed
